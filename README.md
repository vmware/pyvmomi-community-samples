# Philosophy

* Samples belong to the community
  * the community creates the samples
  * the community curates the samples
* A good sample shows how to do one thing and only one thing at a time.
* A good sample follows good code style.
* When arbitrary choices are made, a good sample chooses the simplest default.
* Samples must be willing to teach programming as well as the API

# Code Style

Please conform to pep8 standards. Check your code by running the pep8 tool.
